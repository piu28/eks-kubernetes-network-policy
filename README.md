> Amazon EKS supports native VPC networking via the Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes. Using this CNI plugin allows Kubernetes pods to have the same IP address inside the pod as they do on the VPC network.  In order to implement network policies in your cluster, you must use a compatible container network plugin and Calico is one of the compatible technology.
